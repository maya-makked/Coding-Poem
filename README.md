# Coding-Poem
"Coding" poem by Maya Makked

I love coding and writing poems. I approach both in the same way, which this poem shows. I simulatenously describe writing a poem and program. I decided to code the poem that I wrote about coding and poetry-writing.

I consider this poem to be one of my greatest displays of my interdisciplinary nature. 

There is an image of the poem inside the main folder as well as the code.
